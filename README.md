# JPEG Artifact Removal Tool

This repository contains a course project for the subject Signal and Image Processing. The project focuses on developing a tool for removing JPEG compression artifacts using advanced filtering techniques.

This project uses the [jpeg2png](https://github.com/victorvde/jpeg2png) program to smooth out compression artifacts in JPEG images by converting them to PNG format. You can find more information about this tool in its official repository.
